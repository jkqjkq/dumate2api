title dumate2api - dev (9082/9083)
echo ================================================
echo  Dev instance - single window
echo    Gateway 9082  (stable runs on 9080, unaffected)
echo    Admin   9083
echo ================================================
echo.
echo  This script uses the working tree in this repo (changes often).
echo  For the stable snapshot use stable\start-stable.bat (port 9080).
echo.
rem KEEP THIS FILE PURE ASCII -- see the long note in stable\start-stable.bat.
rem cmd.exe parses .bat by byte offset; under chcp 65001 a multi-byte char can
rem desync it and get part of a line executed as a command (non-deterministic).
cd /d "%~dp0"
set NOPAUSE=%1

rem ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
rem Preflight: make sure 9082/9083 are free before starting anything.
rem Why this exists: if the gateway cannot bind 9082 it exits at once, and the
rem cleanup at the bottom of this script (which runs when the gateway exits)
rem then kills the admin we just started on 9083 -- leaving BOTH ports dead and
rem no obvious reason why. A leftover node from a previous run is the usual
rem cause (stop.bat only targets 9080, so dev leftovers never get cleaned).
rem
rem Policy: a listener that is node.exe is our own leftover -> kill it and
rem continue. Anything else is not ours -> abort WITHOUT killing, so we never
rem silently take down a process we did not start.

rem Admin runs in the background of THIS console (`start /b`), so its output
rem interleaves here instead of taking a second window. Both processes share
rem the console, so closing this window stops both.

rem Wait for admin to bind 9083 so its startup line lands before the gateway's.
rem Use ping, not `timeout`: under a POSIX shell (Git Bash / MSYS) `timeout` is
rem shadowed by the GNU coreutils one, which rejects `/t` and exits non-zero.

rem Kill the admin by the port it listens on. Closing the window would also
rem take it down, but reaching here (Ctrl+C / gateway crash) would otherwise
rem leave it orphaned on 9083. Reuse :preflight so we only ever kill node.exe

echo  Refusing to start (nothing was killed).
